Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases. 

### Access the Network

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way,
but not earn BZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run a Bee
[light node](/docs/access-the-sana/light-nodes) in the background on
your laptop or desktop computer. This will enable direct access to the
swarm from your web browser and other applications.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Support the Network and Earn BZZ by Running a Full Node

Earn [BZZ](/docs/working-with-ant/cashing-out) and help keep the swarm
strong by running your own **full node**. It's easy to set up your own
Bee on a [Raspberry Pi](/docs/installation/rasp-bee-ry-pi), cloud
host, or any home computer that's connected to the internet.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Run Your Own Hive of Nodes

Take it to the next level by keeping a whole hive of Bees! We provide
tooling and monitoring to help you manage large deployments of
multiple Bee nodes: [Bee Hives](/docs/installation/hive).
