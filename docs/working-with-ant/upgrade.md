Keep a close eye on the
[#bee-node-updates](https://discord.gg/vQcngMzZ9c) channel in our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) for information on the
latest software updates for Bee. It's very important to keep Bee up to
date to benefit from security updates and ensure you are able to
properly interact with the Swarm.

:::warning
Bee sure to [backup](/docs/working-with-ant/backups) your clef key material and [cashout your cheques](/docs/working-with-ant/cashing-out) to make sure your BZZs are safe before applying updates.

### Upgrading to mainnet

Mainnet is a totally new network - you can not upgrade a testnet node to a mainnet node. Please create a new Bee and join us in the swarm for real! 🐝

### Upgrading from a testnet v0.6.x series to a testnet v1.0 series

Bee v1.0 contains a few breaking changes which means that database
migration must take place. We also introduced [postage
stamps](/docs/access-the-sana/keep-your-data-alive) which must be
attached to chunks of data so that it will be retained in the Swarm
network.

As part of these changes, if you have any **locally pinned content**,
this must be manually migrated to the new data structure expected by
the network of 1.0 clients. See below for information on how to
proceed.

If you *do not* have any locally pinned content, your migration will
be automatic and your update will proceed as normal.

To check if a 0.6 node has pinned content, query the `pin` api endpoint as follows:

```bash
curl -s localhost:1633/pin/chunks | jq ".chunks | length"
```

```
100
```

If any non-zero values are returned, **you must** complete the manual
migration procedure, automatic migration will be prevented and *you
must* follow the [Manual Migration
Procedure](#manual-migration-procedure).

#### Automatic Migration Procedure

To update **without pinned content:**

1. Optionally, [cashout your node's cheques](/docs/working-with-ant/cashing-out) to make sure your BZZs are safe. If you have cashed out recently, you can skip this step.
2. [Backup your Bee](/docs/working-with-ant/backups) data, especially your keys folder!
3. Upgrade your node, as you normally would (see below).
4. Adjust your networkID in the configuration from `1` to `10` (the new networkID for the testnet). Check out the [configuration](/docs/working-with-ant/configuration) guide for more info on how to update your configuration.
5. Restart your node.

Your Bee should start up as normal, and begin to connect to other Bees that are running Bee 1.0 or later.

#### Manual Migration Procedure

1. [Cashout your node](/docs/working-with-ant/cashing-out) to make sure your BZZs are safe. If you have cashed out recently, you can skip this step.
2. [Backup your Bee](/docs/working-with-ant/backups) data, especially your keys folder!
3. If you have pinned data, Download all your pinned data. Please use these to download all your data ready for re-upload with [postage stamps](/docs/access-the-sana/keep-your-data-alive).
4. Carefully, delete your `localstorage` folder **only**. *DO NOT DELETE* your `keys` or `statestore` folder. Your `localstorage` folder can be located by consulting your Bee's `data-dir` configuration parameter. If you are using Docker, please delete just the contents of the folder.
5. Upgrade your node, as you normally would (see below).
6. Adjust your networkID in the configuration from `1` to `10` (the new networkID for the testnet). Check out the [configuration](/docs/working-with-ant/configuration) guide for more info on how to update your configuration.
7. Restart your node.

Your Bee should start up as normal, and begin to connect to other Bees that are running Bee 1.0.0 or later.

## Upgrade Procedure

### Ubuntu / Debian / Raspbian

To upgrade Bee, simply stop the Bee service.

```sh
sudo systemctl stop bee
```

Now follow the [installation instructions](/docs/installation/install) to download the new package and install the new version, as you would during a new installation.

You will be greeted by the following prompt:

```
Configuration file '/etc/bee/bee.yaml'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** bee.yaml (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
```

Select `N` to keep your current data and keys.

You may now start your node again.

```sh
sudo systemctl start bee
```

#### Manual Installations

To upgrade your manual installation, simply stop Bee, replace the Bee binary and restart.

#### Docker

To upgrade your docker installation, simply increment the version number in your configurations and restart.
