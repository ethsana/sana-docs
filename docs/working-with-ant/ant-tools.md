### Ant Dashboard

Our wonderful community (shout out to [matmertz25](https://github.com/matmertz25)!) have teamed up with our inimitable javascript team, the Ant Gees ðŸ•º , to create [Aee Dashboard](https://github.com/ethsana/ant-dashboard) a graphical user interface for your Ant.

Use this tool to make sure your Ant is functioning correctly, keep an eye on cheques as they accumulate, and cash them out, withdrawal your earned BZZ, and much more! 

Head over to the [Github repo](https://github.com/ethsana/ant-dashboard) for more information on how to install and use *Ant Dashboard*.

### Sana CLI

If you're comfortable with nodejs and the command line, we recommend you try interacting with your Ant using the mighty [sana-cli](https://github.com/ethsana/sana). 

**Sana CLI** is a javascript based companion for your Ant node that can maintain multiple identities, makes it super easy to host your websites and will allow you to interact with some of Sana's more advanced features such as [feeds](/docs/dapps-on-sana/feeds).

Instructions on how to install and use *sana-cli* are maintained at the [Github repository](https://github.com/ethsana/ant-dashboard).
