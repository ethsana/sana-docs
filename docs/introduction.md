Hello and welcome to the sana! We are very happy to have you here with us!

As soon as your Ant client is up and running you will begin to connect with peers all over the world to become a part of Sana, a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the world's data.

Sana is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

Sana is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Sana aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.
