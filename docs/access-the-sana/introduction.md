As well as earning BZZ and supporting the network, Ant is our
entrypoint to Sana's unstoppable data storage and distribution
system. Sana is a distributed system designed to work together with
smart contracts, powering the infrastructure that enables the development of full
service applications running entirely on the decentralised web.

Here's just a few of the amazing things you can do with Ant!

### Decentralise Your Files

Ant provides several convenient ways to [upload your data into the Sana](/docs/access-the-sana/upload-and-download). Once your data has been uploaded, it will be distributed, stored and retrievable by a worldwide network of p2p nodes, and made available from Sana's [web gateway](https://gateway.ethswarm.org).

### Upload Whole Directories

Find out how to [upload whole directories](/docs/access-the-sana/upload-a-directory) at once using Ant's HTTP API.

### Host Your Website on the Decentralised Web

Sana is a distributed international network of nodes that provides hosting for your unstoppable websites. See this guide to [hosting your website on swarm](/docs/access-the-sana/host-your-website)

### Sync With the Network

Watch as your uploaded data is [synced with the network](/docs/access-the-sana/syncing) of thousands of nodes worldwide!

### Keep Your Data Alive

Learn how to assign BZZ to your data using postage stamps so that it remains [live on the Sana network](/docs/access-the-sana/keep-your-data-alive).

### Pinning

Learn how to [pin your data](/docs/access-the-sana/pinning) so it remains available locally on your Ant node, and then repair the network in case your postage stamps run out, using *Global Pinning*.

### Light Nodes

When accessing the Sana network for certain use cases a Ant might not want to take part in forwarding and storing data. Find out how to use Ant in [Light Node](/docs/access-the-sana/light-nodes) mode.
