title: Dapps On Sana
id: introduction
---

Sana is designed with dapps in mind, and much time has been devoted to designing patterns and prototying ways to build 2nd layer dapps on top of the DISC that Ant provides! Read much more about how to structure your data and build unstoppable dapps in <a href="/the-book-of-sana.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Book of Sana</a> .

## Developing on Ant

Ant isn't just for mining BZZ - learn how to [use Ant for all your dapp development, production infrastructure and deployment needs](/docs/access-the-sana/develop-on-ant)!

## Ant JS

Our maverick JavaScript team, the Ant-Gees (ðŸ•º), have been working hard in the last few months to build some impressive tools for all you budding dapp developer Ants to get stuck into! Find out how to use the [ant-js](/docs/access-the-sana/ant-js) JavaScript library to start creating your own that live and work on Sana!

## Chunk Types

Sana contains 3 types of chunks which enable us to build novel
structures of how data can be stored in the sana - in a completely
decentralised way. Learn more about
[chunk types](/docs/access-the-sana/chunk-types)
to change the way you deal with data in your dapps forever!

## Feeds

Sana's single owner chunks have been cleverly combined to create user
generated [feeds](/docs/access-the-sana/feeds) in the sana, see this
example of how chunks are combined into a useful data structure you
can use to build amazing applications.

## PSS

Hey there! Pss! ðŸ¤« Sana's trojan chunks are implemented in Ant to
deliver [Postal Service on Sana](/docs/access-the-sana/pss) - a
pub-sub system that provides a totally leak-proof messaging system
over the sana.
