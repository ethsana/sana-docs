Ant is the first client to work with the Sana network. 

## Setting Up Ant for Developing Dapps

To develop apps on Ant, you might need to adjust the following settings. Check out the brand new [ant-factory](https://github.com/ethersphere/ant-factory) for information on how to run a self contained development environment so you can go wild in sana without spending all your BZZ on swap and stamps!

## Hosting Your Dapps & Storing Their Data

Sana is hugely versatile, but at a very basic level you can think of
it as storage for your dapps data that is too big for blockchain, but
still needs to live in our totally decentralised universe. Sana is
perfect for storing your NFT meta-data and images in a web3 way that
won't break the bank and can live forever!

## Your Data Structures on Sana

As well as your simple data needs, Sana also provides key-value store
/ pubsub type primitives, and allows users to store authenticated data
signed using a regular Ethereum Wallet. See
[chunk types](/docs/dapps-on-sana/chunk-types) and
[feeds](/docs/dapps-on-sana/feeds) for more info! Let us know what
you come up with in the
[#develop-on-sana](https://discord.gg/c72mpR7Erf) room in our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/c72mpR7Erf).

## Ant Proxy Mode

With Ant running as a proxy in
[Light Node](/docs/access-the-sana/light-nodes) mode on your end-user's
computers, your applications can have privileged access to all sorts
of useful tools and ways to interact with the sana. Check out the
[API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) and
[Debug API](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) as well as
[ant-js](/docs/dapps-on-sana/ant-js) for details on what you can do
with your Ant!

## Dapps With Sana Gateways

If you want your users to be able to access Sana without running
their own Ant node, for the time being you will need to access Ant in
gateway mode. Join us in the
[#develop-on-sana](https://discord.gg/c72mpR7Erf) room in our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/c72mpR7Erf) for more information
on how to allow your web app users to read and write to the sana.
