Bee-js is Ant's complementary JavaScript library. It is the technology underpinning the [swarm-cli](/docs/working-with-ant/ant-tools) and [ant-dashboard](/docs/working-with-ant/ant-tools) tools and is a powerful tool for building completely decentralised apps.

For more information on how to develop with Ant without blowing all your BZZ, read [this guide](/docs/dapps-on-sana/develop-on-ant)

See the [bee-js](https://bee-js.ethswarm.org/) documentation for detailed information on using and installing the library.
